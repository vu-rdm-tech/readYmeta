## Description
Characterization of the bacterial community composition of a naturally fermented milk product (lait caill√©), prepared in wooden bowls (lahals) in northern Senegal, which is produced with a bacterial biofilm to steer the fermentation process. A probiotic starter culture containing the most documented probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (generic strain name yoba 2012) was included into the local fermentation process.
